   $ git clone https://github.com/tjclement/esp-dimmer-software.git

   $ wget https://github.com/tjclement/esp-common/raw/255d30d573bb580cbd031145aebf4949e363261f/sendfile.py
   $ chmod +x sendfile.py

4. Connect to wifi called "ESP-xx:xx:xx:xx" with the default password. DHCP needs to be enabled!

6. Open wifiSettings.lua with a text editor and enter your wifi credentials - Save!
